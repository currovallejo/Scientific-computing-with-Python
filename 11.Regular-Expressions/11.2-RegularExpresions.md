```{python}
import re
```

# MATCHING AND EXTRACTING DATA

```{python}
re.search()
```
returns a True/False depending on wheter the string matched the regular expression

```python
re.findall()
```
to stract the matching strings

```python
import re
x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
print(y)
```
In this function [0-9]+ matches one or more digits. So we will get:

```python
['2','19','42']
```
If instead of digits we are looking for some characters:

```python
import re
x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
y = re.findall('[AEIOU]',x)
print(y)
[]
```
It will return an empty list

## Warning: Greedy Matching

The repeat characters (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string

```python
import re
x = 'From: Using the: character'
y = re.findall(^F.+:,x)
print(y)
['From: Using the :']
```
^F.+: MEANS: <br>
^F --> first character in the match is an F <br>
.+ --> one or more characters <br>
:  --> last character in the match is a : <br>
<br>
So, why it is not showing 'From:' ? Because everytime it has the choice, it chooses the largest option. 

## Non-Greedy Matching

just by adding a ? character, the + and * chill out a bit

```python
import re
x = 'From: Using the: character'
y = re.findall(^F.+?:,x)
print(y)
['From:']
```

## Fine-Tuning String Extraction

to determine which portion of the match is to be extracted by using parentheses

```python
import re
x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'
y = re.findall('\S+@\S+',x)
print(y)
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']
```

\S+@\S+ MEANS:<br>
\S+ --> one or more non whitespace character<br>
@ --> followed by a @<br>
\S --> one or more non whitespace character<br>

USING PARENTHESES HELPS TO SPECIFY where to start and stop what string to extract

```python
import re
x = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za'
y = re.findall('^From (\S+@\S+)',x)
print(y)
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za']
```
^From (\S+@\S+) MEANS <br>
^From --> start with 'From'<br>
(\S+@\S+) --> only extract what is inside the parentheses<br>
