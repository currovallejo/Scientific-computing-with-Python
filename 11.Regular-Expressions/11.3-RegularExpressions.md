# PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS

## extracting a host name using find and string slicing

```python
import re
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za '
atpos = data.find('@')
print atpos

sppos = data.find(' ', atpos)
print(sppos)

host = data[atpos+1 : sppos]
# extract from atops+1 up to sppos but not including sppos
print(host)
['uct.ac.za']
```

## the double split pattern

we split a line, grab one word/piece of the line and then we split that piece again

```python
import re
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan Bla Bla'
words = data.split()
email = words[1]
print(email)
['stephen.marquard','uct.ac.za']
pieces = email.split('@')
print(pieces[1])   
['uct.ac.za']
```

## Regex Version

```python
import re
data = 'From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan Bla Bla'
y = re.findall('^From .*@([^ ]*)', data)
print(y)
['uct.ac.za']
```

## Escape character

if you want a special regular expression character to just behave normally (as a character with no "re" meaning) you prefix it with '\\'

```python
import re
data = 'We just received $10.00 for cookies'
y = re.findall('\$[0-9.]+', data)
print(y)
['$10.00']
```
